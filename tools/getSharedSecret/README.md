# Get shared secret
This script was created to get the shared secret of an Steam account to allow protected accounts to make workflows.

## How it works?

Create a .env file, fill with your data and execute. The steam account needs to don't have steam guard enabled. These process will enabled it and output all the information to generate that steam guard key without the app.
